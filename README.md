# Todo List Application

A command-line based Todo List application in Python that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The tasks can be viewed, added, deleted, and marked as completed. Tasks are also saved to a file to ensure persistence across program runs.

## Features

- **View Tasks**: See all your current tasks, along with their completion status (Incomplete/Completed).
- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to your Todo List.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by selecting their task number.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Update the status of a task once it's done.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved to a file (`tasks.txt`) and loaded when the program starts.
